# You Are Typing
Welcome to the You Are Typing repository. This hosts the source code for the app under the same name. You Are Typing is 
an app that lets you chat with yourself when you are having a difficult mental health moment. The idea behind this is 
that you practice self-empathy by tricking your brain into thinking you are talking with a friend undergoing a mental 
health crisis rather than talking to yourself.

## How can I use it?
YAT is not yet available. Please check for updates on https://cvaldez.dev/portfolio/.
