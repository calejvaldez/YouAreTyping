# You Are Typing

Welcome to the You Are Typing repository. This hosts the source code for the app under the same name. You Are Typing is an app that lets you chat with yourself when you are having a difficult mental health moment. The idea behind this is that you practice self-empathy by tricking your brain into thinking you are talking with a friend undergoing the same mental health crisis rather than talking to yourself.

## How can I use it?

You Are Typing is available via my website! Start by [logging in with Access](https://cvaldez.dev/access/login/?app=3).
