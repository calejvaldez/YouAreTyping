## Description

You Are Typing allows you to have a conversation with yourself and be kinder to
yourself. It does this by allowing you to send text messages and switching
the perspective of the text messages, making it seem like the texts you sent are
texts you received.

### Background

I created this program to help me get through rough moments in life. Sometimes
checking in with yourself through a text conversation has been helpful for me,
so maybe it'll be helpful to you too.

### Features

- A text messaging app-like experience
- Switch perspectives with `Enter` + `Control`
- Markdown support for sent messages

## Installation

In order to install the app, you have to compile it yourself. Please view the
[`CONTRIBUTING`](./CONTRIBUTING.md#setting-up-your-environment) document for
more information.

## Support

If you need any help, please open a GitHub issue and I'll try to get on it soon.
