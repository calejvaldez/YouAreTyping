# Structure of the JSON Export

You Are Typing is a journaling program in the form of a texting app. People can
then switch the perspective of the messages so that they can respond to
themselves. This creates an experience where they can journal their feelings
in an honest and private space.

You Are Typing includes an option to export chat messages as a JSON file. These
are the keys in the JSON file:

- **id**: A UUID generated by the program
- **content**: The contents of the message
- **author**: `self` or `other`
- **timestamp**: When the message was sent in Unix seconds
- **bookmarked**: `0` or `1`

The `author` key's values can be either `self` or `other`. If the key is `self`,
that is the initial perspective of the program. If the key is `other`, it is
because it's on the opposite perspective.

The `bookmarked` key can either be `0` or `1`. If the key is `0`, the message
was not bookmarked. Otherwise, the message was bookmarked.

Here's a TypeScript type:

```json
{
    "id": "f489cb2b-94a7-4d43-bf4b-0ffac5156b5e",
    "content": "I'm excited for the future",
    "author": "self",
    "timestamp": 1685046943,
    "bookmarked": 0
}
```
